# Typical performance bottlenecks
=================================
Database
========
1- Working size exceeds available RAM
2- Long running queries
3- Large joins taking up memory

Programming:
===========
1- Threads: deadlocks
2- Event driven programming: callback complexity
3- Bad design : desing didn't take in consedration one of the following before developing:
	a- Number of consuming users at the same time
	b- New possible features (which make each new change affect the code complexity and applicaion performance)
	c- Users categories, which make regular users allocate unnecessary resources
4- Algorithm complexity
5- Dependent services you may block on.
6- Stack space
7- Re-develop algorithms existed in the STL

Memory
======
1- Out of memory, kills process
2- Memory library overhead


# How can they be located?
==========================
1- Profiling
2- Tracing
3- Logging


# How can they be fixed?
====================================
1- Refactoring
2- Use well known desing patterns
3- Review each algorithm complexity
